**FreeCodeCamp Projects Repository**

This repository contains the source code for all of my completed FreeCodeCamp projects. It includes challenges and exercises from various FreeCodeCamp certifications, organized in separate folders for easy reference and learning.

**Folder Structure: **
Each folder corresponds to a specific set of challenges or exercises from a FreeCodeCamp certification. The folders are organized in the order in which the projects were completed. Below is a brief explanation of each folder's contents:
    [Folder Name 1]: Description of what this folder contains.
    [Folder Name 2]: Description of what this folder contains.
    [Folder Name 3]: Description of what this folder contains.

**Purpose**
The goal of this repository is to keep track of my progress through FreeCodeCamp, allowing me to revisit solutions, study the progression of my learning, and help others who may be working through similar challenges. Each project is a result of completing a FreeCodeCamp certification, and the code is presented exactly as I completed the exercises.
Feel free to browse the folders, check out the code, or use it as a reference for your own learning.
